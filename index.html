        <h1>THE STATE OF HOMELESSNESS IN SHEFFIELD</h1>
        <h2>By Alexander Ellis.</h2>

    <section class="content">
      <h2>The Issue</h2>
      <p>Taking an evening walk through the central Sheffield on a Saturday provides a pleasant atmosphere, shops are bustling with families, couples are enjoying meals out and bars are filled with characters who have spent their working week waiting to get bladdered for the weekend.</p>

      <p>But when one is walking around the city centre you will notice the number of beggars that are scattered across the pavements. Some say they need change for food, some for accommodation and others will not even be able to look up at you in their sedated states.<p>

      <p>In 2016/17, there was a four percent rise in the number of households accepted as homeless by Sheffield City Council since 2010/11. Concerns were made apparent following a high proportion of single people/households without children being 48% compared to the national average of 28%.</p>

      <p>The council have now created a Homelessness Prevention Strategy which will run from 2017 to 2022 which has been developed through feedback from customers, service providers and other stakeholders.</p>

      <blockquote>“We will minimise homelessness in Sheffield by focussing on early prevention to help people keep their home or move in a planned way to a new settled home.”</blockquote>

      <p>They state that they will provide good quality housing options to allow people affected to resolve their housing problems with effective and durable solutions if a crisis occurs.</p>

      <p>However, based on the new Homelessness Reduction Act 2018, the council will now have to adhere to significant changes which affects the housing options and support available including cuts to welfare benefits and severe reductions in public sector budgets.<p>

      <p>With the highest proportion of homeless referrals to Sheffield Council being people aged between 25-44 (60%) this figure shows a growing concern of how many people who still have potential futures ahead of them are still on the streets.<p>

        <h1>Meet Paige and Steve.</h1>

      </header>

    </section>

    <section class="content">

      <p>Walking down Division Street it wass visibly shocking to see how young Paige looked, she is 20-years-old and has been homeless since she was the age of 16. </p>

      <p>Originally from Leeds, she was kicked out by her Mother due to her relationship with her boyfriend at the time.</p>

      <p>With no where else to go Paige was forced to roam the streets and experienced many extremely traumatic situations over the years where she has been raped, stabbed and kidnapped.<p>

  <p>She then moved to Sheffield to be with her current boyfriend, Steve who is 30-years-old, and to get away from the violence she was experiencing in Leeds. </p>

  <div class="Paige_Steve">

    <div><img src="images/PaigeSteve2.jpg" /></div>
    <div><img src="images/PaigeSteve3.jpg" /></div>
  </div>

      <p>Paige and Steve have been looking to be housed for a year and a half but ran into problems due to the fact Paige was from Leeds which causes issues for being rehomed in Sheffield. </p>

      <p>If someone is from a different city than the current city they are based in they, require a local connection to be housed there. </p>

      <p>The requirements of proving whether you have a local connection to the area are; whether you are living or working in the area, if you have close family in the area or other special reasons. </p>

      <p>Despite the council having 600 empty homes on a shortlist for the homeless, the couple are still waiting to find their home but the system they have to go through has delayed this and only caused further complications.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/shefftentcity/"target="_blank">Sheff Tent City</a> began in 2016 after Anthony discovered people on Park Hill landings and noticing an increase of homeless people within the city centre. He then put out a Facebook status asking friends to see if they were up for going out and supplying clothing and food to those who needed it. </p>

      <p>From there, he began his mission to start reducing homelessness in Sheffield as much as he possibly could. He started to go out and talk to those in misfortunate positions which lead him to becoming involved in physically assisting the rehousing of these individuals.</p>

      <p>By January 2017, a physical tent city had been formed within the Park Hill flats site where a tight knit community was created which even featured its own mini shop which was filled with donations from the public.</p>

      <p>However, a warrant was executed by the police and the council which brought the tent city to an end due to the fact “it was not safe and better accommodation was accessible.”</p>

      <video width=800 controls>
      <source src="images/tentcity.mp4" type+"video/mp4">
      </video>

<blockquote>“It’s a minefield to try to get someone housed.”</blockquote>

<p>Anthony carries on to state that Sheffield City Council don’t want to take responsibility for their jobs. He mentions that for a 21-year-old boy from Portugal to have access to benefits, he has to be in work and received a certain number of payslips, but he only has three months before he is cut off. </p>

<p>This has lead Anthony to focus his efforts on those more likely to be able to recieve benefits but still, it is not an easy task where one man almost took his own life last week after giving up hope on ever being rehoused again.

  </section>

  <section class="content">

    <p>32-year-old Paul has been homeless for about 6 months and is currently living in a tent just off of St Mary’s Gate after his missus had left him after ten years of being together. </p>

    <p>Raised on Manor in Sheffield, he was in the army before he became homeless and his attempts to get off the streets have been unsuccessful so far due to the fact he is unable to apply for benefits as he doesn’t have a permanent address. </p>

<p>Currently he relies on public donations to get by day to day, however, he mentions how ‘holiday tappers’ – people who have places to live but go out begging to earn money – make it harder for individuals who are genuinely homeless to get out of their situation. </p>

    <div class="flex_container">

        </div>

<blockquote>“That acknowledgement is priceless.”</blockquote>

    <p>He stays away from drugs but understands why many genuine homeless take them as it is their way of coping with life. Life on the streets is dangerous and, on several occasions, Paul mentions he has been attacked by drunk passers-by where one time he had a brick thrown at him while he was asleep. </p>

<p>Paul does have a lifeline as he has sent an application to be relisted into the army where he says: “I’m just waiting on an email to basically get a briefing and then do my initial training again.” Soon enough, I hope he will be integrating back into his job and rebuilding the life he has previously lost.</p>

  <p>Sheffield in the 1980s was facing a massive decline due to the rate of reduction its industry was having which raised levels of unemployment, poverty and poor health. </p>

  <p>St Paul’s Cathedral had become a place of shelter for people who had nowhere else to go by 1989. They began to provide basic breakfast and soon became a safe haven for the homeless who felt welcome there.</p>

  <p>Nowadays, the project has become the perfect rehabilitation centre for the homeless to learn new skills, have the opportunity to see be seen by the in-house nurse and attempt to reintegrate with society.</p>

<iframe width="800" height="555" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A-jsabUKdqg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<blockquote>The more opportunities we gave people, the more people were ready to change into looking into different lifestyles.</blockquote>

<p>The cathedral contains showers, laundry services, professional kitchen, a medical room and an education/activity room.</p>

  <p>They have provided employment for the homeless that use the centre through the staffing of their kitchen and also a t-shirt printing company which has provided them important life skills to be learnt.</p>

    <h1>Meet Emma.</h1>

</section>

<section class="content">

  <p>Two years ago, 39-year-old Emma was given the news that her partner killed himself after 22 years of being together. This left her heartbroken and lost which lead to her becoming homeless for just over a year now. </p>

  <p>However, when she had nowhere else to go or no one to talk to, she says Anthony from Tent City provided the most support for her during these difficult times.</p>

  <figure>
  <img src="images/emmadawg.jpg" height="650"alt="">
  <figcaption>Emma's faithful dog; Coco.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Through her heartbreak, Emma found drugs as a way to relieve the pain which were easily accessible as she states that where she had been sleeping for the night in a tent, drug dealers would arrive to these known spots to sell their narcotics.</p>

  <p>She is now being prescribed Methadone to deal with her addictions to crack cocaine and heroin where she gets two daily doses to ease her physical symptoms. </p>

  <p>More homeless people are dying on the streets and this is due to the fact that drugs are being made stronger by dealers. </p>

  <video width=800 controls>

  <p>The lack of publicity by the media to highlight these deaths is alarming, if they did raise awareness of the dangers being posed by unregulated drug taking, people’s lives could be saved. </p>

    <h1>Conclusion.</h1>
  </header>

</section>

<section class="content">

  <p>With the highest proportion of homeless referrals to Sheffield Council being people aged between 25-44 (60%) it will be interesting to see how the council will effectively push their prevention scheme.</p>

  <p>With more and more young people being kicked out of their family homes from the ages of 16 to 18, creating awareness and providing support for these individuals in vulnerable situations will be a massive assistance to help reduce the numbers of homeless people.</p>

  <p>What appears to be the biggest issue is the lack of support from the council in rehoming people trapped in these situations, but through the help of local projects, action is still being made to make sure that not all hope is lost.</p>
